#Roost!

Roost open source implementation of a nest-like ESP8266 project

This project is to teach basic IoT and microprocessor programming using the Arduino IDE, ESP8266 processor, and a collection of off the shelf sensors. Ambient temperature, humidity, and motion are sensed and uploaded to the cloud. Output is also sent to the serial port and to a small OLED screen.

##Setup IDE and Libraries

Get the IDE and required libraries downloaded and installed from the internet.

Install latest Arduino IDE
>https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

Download libraries from github.com (list in Roost! project)

Install esp8266 environment from github.com into IDE

##Part 1: Blink, WiFi, and Web
Blink lights, connect to network, and say hello.

Wire up Lab1 - LEDs

Code Lab1 - LEDs (blink)

Code Lab2 - WiFi (serial show IP address)

Code Lab3 - Hello Web (simple web page)

##Part2: OLED Display
Web is good, local is useful too

Wire up Lab4 - OLED

Code Lab4 - OLED

##Part 3: Time, Temp, and Motion
Get the time, temperature, humidity and motion. Show the class

Code Lab5 - NTP (get time, add to web page)

Wire up Lab6 - DHT

Code Lab6 - DHT (add temp and humidity to web page)

Wire up Lab7 - PIR

Code Lab7 - PIR (add motion to web page)

##Part 4: Ping and Data.SparkFun.com

Wire up Lab8 - Ping (optional depending on time)

Code Lab8 - Ping (add more motion to web page)

Code Lab9 - data.sparkfun.com (Push Data to the web- may spill over to day 2)
