# Roost
Roost open source implementation of a nest-like ESP8266 project

This project is to teach basic IoT and microprocessor programming using the Arduino IDE, ESP8266 processor, and a collection of off the shelf sensors. Ambient temperature, humidity, and motion are sensed and uploaded to the cloud. Output is also sent to the serial port and to a small OLED screen.
